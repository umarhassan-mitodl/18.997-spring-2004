Sample Problems in 18.997: Topics in Combinatorial Optimization
---------------------------------------------------------------

Even though 18.997 does not have regular problem sets, problems are occasionally mentioned in lecture for people to work on. Here is a sample of such questions:

*   Petersen's theorem (Lecture 3) says that every cubic bridgeless graph contains a perfect matching. Show that for any even set _T_ of vertices, a bridgeless cubic graph (_V_,_E_) contains a _T_\-join of cardinality at most |V|/2 where a _T_\-join is a subgraph with odd degree at vertices in _T_ and even at vertices not in _T_.  
      
    
*   Show that a graph is such that every edge is in a perfect matching if and only if it admits a _bipartite_ ear decomposition, where a bipartite ear decomposition is one that starts from an even cycle and repeatedly adds an odd path between vertices of different colors.  
      
    
*   Consider a strongly connected digraph _D_ and a valid ordering _O_ (lectures 7, 8). Show that a covering of the vertices by directed cycles of total minimum index can be obtained by network flows. What does network flow duality tells you here?  
      
    
*   (Open.) Consider a matroid and assume _S_ can be partitioned into _k_ bases. Can one number cyclically be the element of _S_ such that any sequence of _k_ consecutive elements form a basis? Prove it when the numbering is not required to be cyclic.  
      
    
*   Read a proof of (the strong version of) Nash-Williams's theorem saying that any undirected graph can be oriented so as to preserve half of the _local_ connectivity rounded down. Can you provide an elementary proof?
